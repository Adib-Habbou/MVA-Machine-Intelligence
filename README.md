# Image Processing Repository

Welcome to the Image Processing Repository! This repository showcases a collection of Term Projects and a Final Project focused on various aspects of image processing and quality assessment.

## Term Projects

### TP1: Image Pipeline
This project revolves around developing an efficient image processing pipeline. It includes algorithms for image enhancement, filtering, and segmentation. It demonstrates different techniques to improve image quality and processing speed.

### TP2: Calibration Measurements
The second term project focuses on calibration measurements within images. It explores methods to correct lens distortion, color calibration, geometric transformations, and pixel intensity normalization. This project emphasizes precision and accuracy in image measurements.

### TP3: Image Quality Assessment
TP3 deals with assessing the quality of images. It covers algorithms and metrics to quantify image sharpness, noise, contrast, and color accuracy. The project evaluates various approaches to objectively measure image quality.

## Final Project: Retro Engineering DxO PhotoLab's Contrast Settings

The final project is an in-depth analysis of the contrast settings in DxO PhotoLab. It involves reverse engineering and understanding the six contrast settings employed by the software. The project explores the underlying algorithms, their impact on image enhancement, and attempts to replicate or improve upon these settings.

### Project Components:
- **Reverse Engineering Process**: Documentation and findings from reverse engineering DxO PhotoLab's contrast settings.
- **Algorithm Development**: Implementations or improvements on the contrast algorithms.
- **Comparison and Analysis**: Comparison of the replicated/modified settings against the original DxO PhotoLab settings.
- **Performance Metrics**: Quantitative evaluation of the achieved results in terms of image enhancement and quality.
